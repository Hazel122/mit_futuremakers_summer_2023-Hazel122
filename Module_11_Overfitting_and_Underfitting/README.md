# Overfitting and Underfitting

## Topics covered in today's module
* Overfitting
* Underfitting
* Data preparation
* Reducing network capacity

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Need to do data cleaning for NLP to deal with high dimensions.
* bias: how close with ground truth (lower the better)
* variance: how much model will change from one dataset to another (lower the better)

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Solutions to overfitting is interesting and practical: decrease model's complexity, and use dropout layers.
